# AMA Volunteer Support Analytics App

A data-driven application built to support *AMA (Amigos Anônimos)*, an organization dedicated to *suicide prevention and emotional support*.

This project helps AMA monitor and analyze the number of support interactions handled by volunteer responders across phone lines and digital channels. By organizing attendance data by time period, the system enables the identification of peak demand hours, improving volunteer allocation and operational planning.

## Why this project matters

Behind every number, there is a person seeking help.

Organizations that provide emotional support often rely on volunteer teams working in shifts, and understanding when demand increases is essential for ensuring timely assistance. This application was created to transform service records into actionable insights, helping AMA strengthen its response capacity and support more people effectively.
